# SINGLE WORKFLOW for merge + all deploys
#
# Why one file instead of separate workflows per deploy type:
#   - The merge into main MUST happen first and only once. Separate workflows
#     would each need the merge step, creating a race condition (two workflows
#     trying to merge the same branch simultaneously).
#   - Splitting would require a shared merge workflow + workflow_run triggers,
#     adding complexity for no benefit.
#   - Each deploy step is already independent and conditional (only runs when
#     its files changed), so it behaves like separate deploys within one pipeline.
#   - Adding a new GAS project = adding one more conditional step. Simple.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Push to claude/* branch triggers this workflow
#   1a. Guard: detect inherited branches via dual-source commit-SHA tracking,
#       commit-timestamp-vs-repo-creation check, IS_TEMPLATE_REPO mismatch,
#       and already-merged check — delete and skip
#   2. Merge into main (once)
#   3. Check what changed (git diff)
#   4. Deploy GAS projects — only if their Code.gs was modified
#   5. Delete the claude branch
#   6. Deploy GitHub Pages — only if live-site-pages/ files were modified
#   7. Direct pushes to main skip merge and just deploy
#   8. On every main push, sweep and delete any stale claude/* branches
#      that are already merged (self-healing cleanup)
#   9. Brand-new repos (< 10 min old) skip deploy and cleanup — import
#      push events are not user actions
#  10. SHA update commits use [skip ci] to prevent cascading workflow runs
#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW GAS PROJECT:
#
#   Prerequisites — collect these from the new Apps Script project:
#     - DEPLOYMENT_ID    : Web app deployment ID (from Deploy → Manage deployments)
#                          This is also the long string in the /exec URL
#     - SPREADSHEET_ID   : Google Sheets ID (from the sheet URL between /d/ and /edit)
#     - SHEET_NAME       : Name of the sheet tab to read/write (e.g. "Live_Sheet")
#     - GITHUB_TOKEN     : Set in Apps Script: Project Settings → Script Properties
#                          Key: GITHUB_TOKEN  Value: github_pat_... token
#     - SOUND_FILE_ID    : Google Drive file ID for the GAS "Test Sound" button (optional)
#     - EMBED_PAGE_URL   : The GitHub Pages URL where this GAS app is iframed (optional)
#     - SPLASH_LOGO_URL  : Logo shown on the blue "Code Ready" splash screen (optional)
#
#   Steps:
#     1. Create a folder in googleAppsScripts/ (e.g. "My New Project")
#     2. Copy Code.gs from an existing project as a template
#     3. Update the PROJECT CONFIG section at the top of Code.gs:
#          var VERSION        = "01.00g";
#          var TITLE          = "My New Project";
#          var SPREADSHEET_ID = "your-spreadsheet-id";
#          var SHEET_NAME     = "Live_Sheet";
#          var GITHUB_OWNER   = "<your-github-org>";
#          var GITHUB_REPO    = "<your-repo-name>";
#          var GITHUB_BRANCH  = "main";
#          var FILE_PATH      = "googleAppsScripts/My New Project/Code.gs";
#          var DEPLOYMENT_ID  = "your-deployment-id";
#          var SOUND_FILE_ID  = "your-drive-file-id";
#          var EMBED_PAGE_URL = "https://<your-org>.github.io/<your-repo>/your-page.html";
#          var SPLASH_LOGO_URL = "https://your-logo-url";
#     4. Bootstrap: manually copy-paste Code.gs into the Apps Script editor and save
#        (first deploy must be manual — doPost can't deploy itself before it exists)
#     5. Add a new step in this workflow BEFORE "Delete branch", using this template:
#
#        - name: Deploy My New Project
#          run: |
#            git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -q "googleAppsScripts/My New Project/Code.gs" && \
#            curl -L -X POST \
#              "https://script.google.com/macros/s/DEPLOYMENT_ID_HERE/exec" \
#              -d "action=deploy" \
#              --max-time 120 || true
#
#     6. Replace DEPLOYMENT_ID_HERE with the project's deployment ID
#     7. That's it — the step only runs when that project's Code.gs changes
