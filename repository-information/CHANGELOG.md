## [Unreleased]

## [v01.08r] — 2026-03-08 03:12:53 PM EST

### Added
- Added `[template]` origin labels to ARCHITECTURE.md Mermaid diagram — file nodes and file-centric subgraphs are prefixed with `[template]` to distinguish template-origin components from fork-added ones
- Added `Origin` column to all STATUS.md tables — template-origin entries show `template`, making it immediately visible which rows came from the template
- Added template origin label rules to Pre-Commit #5 (STATUS.md Origin column) and #6 (ARCHITECTURE.md node/subgraph labels), including `[template · modified]` tracking on non-template repos

## [v01.07r] — 2026-03-08 03:04:33 PM EST

### Added
- Added `[template · modified]` label rule to Pre-Commit #8 — on non-template repos, template-origin files update their label to `[template · modified]` when edited, showing the file was customized from the original template

## [v01.06r] — 2026-03-08 03:01:03 PM EST

### Added
- Added `[template]` origin labels to every entry in README project structure tree — distinguishes template-origin files from files added in forks

## [v01.05r] — 2026-03-08 02:53:07 PM EST

### Fixed
- Added missing sound files (`Website_Ready_Voice_1.mp3`, `Code_Ready_Voice_1.mp3`) to README project structure tree — `sounds/` directory was listed but its contents were not expanded
- Added completeness audit rule to Pre-Commit #8 (README.md structure tree) — directories must have their contents fully expanded, not just listed as leaf nodes

## [v01.04r] — 2026-03-08 02:48:28 PM EST

### Fixed
- Added missing `.editorconfig` and `.gitignore` to README project structure tree

## [v01.03r] — 2026-03-08 02:31:16 PM EST

### Removed
- Removed testation7 and testation8 environments — deleted HTML pages, GAS scripts, config files, version files, changelogs, and changelog archives (18 files total)
- Removed testation7 and testation8 GAS deploy steps from auto-merge workflow
- Removed testation7 and testation8 entries from STATUS.md hosted pages and GAS projects tables

## [v01.02r] — 2026-03-08 02:05:10 PM EST

### Fixed
- Fixed non-index page URLs in chat bookends ending with `/` instead of `.html` — added explicit rule for non-index pages (e.g. `testation7.html`) to use `.html` suffix in live site URLs
- Fixed init script not resetting `TEMPLATE_DEPLOY` to `Off` on forks — forks no longer inherit the template's `On` state, preventing false template-repo detection in URL display logic

## [v01.01r] — 2026-03-07 03:15:58 PM EST

### Changed
- Re-enabled `TEMPLATE_DEPLOY` toggle (`Off` → `On`) to restore GitHub Pages deployment on the template repo
