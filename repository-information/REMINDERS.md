# Reminders

Items the user asked to be reminded about at the start of the next session. Claude reads this file during the Session Start Checklist and surfaces any active reminders before proceeding.

## Active Reminders

- `2026-02-28 02:06:00 AM EST` — **Consider creating a session recap file** — a file that logs the last few things done in each session so Claude can catch up quickly in a new session (context continuity across sessions)
- `2026-02-28 02:11:45 AM EST` — **Check test.html issues in Chrome DevTools** — open test.html in Chrome, use Inspect/DevTools to review all issues (Console errors, warnings, etc.) and see if we can resolve/eliminate all of them
