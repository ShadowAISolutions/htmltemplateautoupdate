# Changelog Archive

Older version sections rotated from [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Full granularity preserved — entries are moved here verbatim when the main changelog exceeds 20 version sections.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with per-entry EST timestamps and project-specific versioning (`w` = website, `g` = Google Apps Script, `r` = repository).
